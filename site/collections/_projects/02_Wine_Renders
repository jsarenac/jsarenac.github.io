The client is a winery from Italy that wanted its products reproduced as high fidelity models, and then rendered with a simple lighting setup.

Particular attention was paid in the visuals where the wine was shown poured in a glass. The subtle shifts of colour of multiple varieties of wine where carefully captured. Another challenge was adding bubbles and foam to those wines that needed it.
