Wheather for aiding the design process or for filling in the backrounds of redners, photogrammetry provides a solution to creating existing buildings. Using street-view images of a site I create exisitng structures to a high degree of accuracy. I have helped numerous design teams complete their projects by building up a particular location from photographs.

You can see the way the building models are overlaid onto images in order to model accurately.
