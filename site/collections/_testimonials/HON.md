blurb: Jovan has been working with us on our projects at House of Nuances, taking care of the 3D modeling. Honestly, it feels like there’s nothing he can’t model - whether it’s a super minimal object or the most ornate chair. The best part is that he is fast, reliable, and always has our back, which in this line of work is pure gold. Fiona Sindjelić, founder HON, Berlin.
