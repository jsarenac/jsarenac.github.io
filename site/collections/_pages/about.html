      <p>Truss.rs is re-launching with a clean new template to showcase the vast variety of work we undertook over the years in the best possible way. New features such as a model viewer as well as a building walk through example will be added in the future.

      After completing my BSc in Architecture at the University of Bath in the UK I settled in Belgrade and started working in 3d modeling and illustration. Truss was founded in 2017 and since then has collaborated with designers, visualizers and architects from the USA and EU.</p>
