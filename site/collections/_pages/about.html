      <p>After completing my BSc in Architecture at the University of Bath in the UK I settled in Belgrade and started working in 3d modeling and illustration. Truss was founded in 2017 and since then has collaborated with designers, visualizers and architects from the USA and EU.

      Apart from architectural visualisation I have worked on product models and visuals for marketing purposes. Clients wanted to show clean and accurate images of their products as well as combined renders and stock photos that could better illustrate the products in use.
      More recently my work has shifted to complex modeling of unique pieces of furniture or décor in order to aid other studios in their interior visualization projects. Having a reputation as someone who can quickly and correctly model even the most challenging objects has been a difficult yet very rewarding experience. I hope to keep building a reputation for both tackling a vast variety of modeling work as well as re-creating complicated and unusual materials.</p>

      <p>Apart from working on computer graphics I personally have maintained a passion and appreciation for architecture. I hope that this earnest interest in design comes through in my 3d work. Moreover as a contrast to my digital work I paint and draw in my free time. More of my personal work can be found here.</p>
