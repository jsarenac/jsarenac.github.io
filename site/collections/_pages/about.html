      <p>After completing my BSc in Architecture at the University of Bath in the UK I settled in Belgrade and started working in 3d modeling and illustration. Truss was founded in 2017 and since then has collaborated with designers, visualizers and architects from the USA and EU.

      Apart from architectural visualisation I have worked on product models and visuals for marketing purposes. Clients wanted to show clean and accurate images of their products as well as combined renders and stock photos that could better illustrate the products in use.</p>
